Basic (naive) CUDA implementation of Matrix Multiply on GPU with increasing Matrix Sizes (100*100, 1000*1000, 10000*10000), with thread block dimension of (16,16) and Ploted execution time (with and without memory transfer).

Basic (naive) CUDA implementation of Matrix Multiply on GPU with  use memory coalescing to enhance the memory access efficiency and reduce memory divergence and Plotted execution time (with and without memory transfer). 

Basic (naive) CUDA implementation of Matrix Multiply (without memory coalescing and shared memory with tiling) with increasing Matrix Sizes (100*100, 1000*1000, 10000*10000), with thread block dimension of (16,16). Plotted execution time (with and without memory transfer).

Basic (naive) CUDA implementation of Matrix Multiply with memory coalescing only. Plotted execution time (with and without memory transfer).
